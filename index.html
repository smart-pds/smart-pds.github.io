        <p class="lead">The workshop is going to take place in the 2019 IEEE Smart World Congress and the 3rd IEEE
            Conference on Smart City Innovations (IEEE SCI 2019) will be held in Leicester, UK between 19-23 August 2019
            at De Montfort University.IEEE SCI 2019 will include a highly selective program of technical papers,
            accompanied by workshops, demos, panel discussions and keynote presentations. Original contributions are
            welcome from both a technical and application perspective. The theme of the 2019 edition will be to
            investigate how Smart City Innovations can manage issues surrounding reliability in addition to considering
            how ideas and concepts can be deployed on a large scale.</p>

    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p>
        Decision making is a core activity in daily human lives. Despite its increasing importance to cope with various
        problems in the context of smart cities (such as planning, energy assessment, policy-making, etc.), decision
        making can sometimes become a daunting task due to e.g. the participation of large and diverse groups of
        stakeholders with conflicting opinions, or the presence of numerous decision criteria and humongous relevant
        data. Effective and highly scalable Decision Support Systems are thus on high demand in these settings.
        Recommender Systems (RecSys) are a widespread data-driven decision support paradigm to provide users with
        personalisation services, tailored products or relevant information based on analyzing - and learning from -
        data describing their preferences, profile, context, behavioural patterns, etc. Personalisation and decision
        support approaches are impacting our daily lives not only as customers but more generally as citizens, visitors,
        patients, etc. Adapting to the current and ever-changing context around citizens and visitors, and helping them
        make the right decisions amid numerous available options, provides an added value in improving their experience
        and helping them benefit from on-demand services. Example domains in these contexts include: (i) recommending
        free time activities or events, (ii) suggesting suitable touristic places to visit, (iii) assisting citizens
        with the best route between two locations, or (iv) encouraging their participation in government decision-making
        activities of their interest, to name a few.

        This workshop aims at attracting demonstrations of novel research to tackle challenges faced in smart cities,
        with a particular focus on Big Data-driven user personalisation and large-scale decision-making problems.
        Research topics include applications, techniques and methods with or without case studies, related to
        personalisation applications of hybrid and context-aware recommender systems, solving the cold-start problem in
        smart city contexts, preference elicitation and its integration with Big Data, multi-criteria and group decision
        support systems at scale. Researchers and practitioners working in different fields are encouraged to submit
        their research contributions and ideas in addition to demonstrators and visual materials such as posters.

    <h3 id="keynote">Keynote: Dr. Mohammad M. Ghassemi</h3>
    <p><b>Title:</b> The Challenges and Opportunities for Healthcare Recommendation Systems in a Rapidly Evolving Health
        Data Ecosystem.</p>
    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are rich, and often highly heterogeneous,
        sources of data. In the last ten years, there has been ample interest in how the growing volume of EHR data may
        be used to better monitor and support decisions at the bedside, with several of the largest industrial players
        now entering the arena (Google, Apple Microsoft and Amazon). But EHR systems are designed to mitigate clinical
        liability and facilitate billing, not to support algorithm development. As the most well-resourced data
        companies continue their push into healthcare domain, EMR systems will inevitably change to accommodate
        algorithm designers. In this talk, we will present several case studies that highlight the challenges and
        opportunities that are available in this rapidly evolving data ecosystem, and the import role that academic
        researchers can play in forging the future of recommendation systems in health.
    </p>
    <p><b>Biography:</b> Dr. Mohammad M. Ghassemi is the co-founder and President of the Ghamut Corporation (winner of
